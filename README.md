# BlockList

In this project I am just merging 3 commonly used blocklists. It is intended to just be a small project to play around with Github workflows
with minor use of solving a local problem I had with my AdGuard Home instance, which tended to freak out with too many filters set.

You can just copy this list into your AdGuard Home instance and enjoy all the filters. 
It isn't the cleanest, since I am currently not removing all the comment lines, but it atleast removes any dupes found.
